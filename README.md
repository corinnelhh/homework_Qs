1. The solution shown here is an object-oriented implementation of <a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Peter Norvig's algorithm</a>. The pre-processing stage for the algorithm is simple; the program reads in a file provided at the command line (i.e. `python solve.py input.txt`) and parses a 9x9 csv-separated multi-line grid into an 81-character string containing digits and dots representing cells with unknown values. The algorithm works by first providing a unique alphanumeric identifier (i.e. 'A1' or 'G6') for each cell in the 9 x 9 grid, and then by identifying each individual cell by membership in three 'units' (the cell's row, column, and subsquare). The next step the algorithm takes is to cast these cells into a dictionary/hash table, where each cell name points to a string representing all possible values for a Sudoku cell (i.e. '123456789').
